/*
try_get() returns 2 value. bool represents whether it reaches EOF. true means it reaches EOF.
When it reaches EOF. the first member of the pair is guarantee to be 0.

However. EOF in a lot of cases are useless. You should use get() instead to prevent EOF hacking.

get() will throw exception including EOF
try_get() will throw exception excluding EOF
